                    <p>About project:  Built a website on VEHICLE SERVICE CENTRE, where If customer got any 
                        problem with his vehicle based on asked details, they are providing 
                        services. The real power of this project lies not in direct selling of 
                        products, but in the creation of tighter relationships with customers and 
                        delivering of a high level of service and support.</p>

                    <p>About project: Final year Project “Animal Detection in Man – Made Environment”, 
                        here we used the python language and Django frame work for building project. 
                        Here we used the CNN to classify and process the image of animals. In this 
                        project the camera detects the animals and if the animal is wild the user will
                        get alarm and mail.</p>
